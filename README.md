This is a collection of various utility/helper code and tools for developers to interact with Fabric easily. The tools and code would provide support for processing Avro messages, generate message samples, sending messages to Fabric, etc. If you have useful library/tool that you want to share with others, please fork this repository, add your code and send a pull request. We would love to keep this folder as much open as possible with community contributions.
