==What?

This is a Ruby script to generate a JSON message for a hosted schema.

==Why?

Some schemas are nested deep and it is quite hard and error prone to come up with a valid JSON message.

==How?
* Download the files. 
* ruby generate_message.rb <schema_url>
	* ruby generate_message.rb https://ocl.xcommercecloud.com/inventory/stockItem/updateQuantityFailed/1.0.0

==About the code

Any enhancements and improvements are welcome. Feel free to submit a  pull request.
