==What?
X.commerce message contracts are described in Avro IDL format. You can find the
list of contracts https://github.com/xcommerce/X.commerce-Contracts

Typically, the schema generated from these contracts are hosted on the X.commerce cloud server.
However, for a developer either wanting to generate a schema for an experimental
contract or generate a schema for a contract that has not yet been hosted on the OCL cloud,
this script will let them generate schemas for all the topics described by the AVDL file.

==How?
Download the entire contents of this directory and run it using
./generate_schema_from_idl <filename.avdl>

This will generate a bunch of schema files with an extension (avsc) for each
topic defined in the AVDL.
