What is this?

A product taxonomy tree view

How
===

Currently this is a two step process.

1. The ProductTaxonomy JSON file is post processed to generate a hierarchical JSON file that can be used with JSTree, a jquery tree plugin.
2. The Post processed JSON file is used to render a tree view

For the sake of demo, nothing needs to be done from the user's end.

1. Clone the repo and open index.html file in the browser and you should be good to go.
2. If the ProductTaxonomy JSON file changes, capture those updates in pt.json and rerun the parsing script.
3. The changes will be reflected when you open/refresh the browser.

Files
===

1. Parse.rb is a ruby script that walks through the Product Taxonomy JSON generated by GET (pt.json) and post processes it into a hierarchical JSON as required by jstree
2. temp.json is the JSON file generated from step 1 (./parse.rb > temp.json)
3. jstree is the JavaScript tree library used from http://jstree.com
4. index.html is a sample html code that renders the tree view from temp.json
