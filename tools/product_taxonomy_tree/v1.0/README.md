What is this?
===

A product taxonomy tree view

How
===

Currently this is a two step process.

1. The ProductTaxonomy JSON file is post processed to generate a hierarchical JSON file that can be used with JSTree, a jquery tree plugin.
2. The Post processed JSON file is used to render a tree view


Files
===

1. Parse.rb is a ruby script that walks through the Product Taxonomy JSON generated by GET (pt.json) and post processes it into a hierarchical JSON as required by jstree
2. temp.json is the JSON file generated from step 1 (./parse.rb > temp.json)
3. jstree is the JavaScript tree library used from http://jstree.com
4. index.html is a sample html code that renders the tree view from temp.json
